# Muse

An AI-powered music recommendation engine and scrapper.

## TODO
* [ ] Fill these docs.
* [ ] Refactor MFExtractor class for tight CLI integration.
      (Future used as a helper script by some super structure.)
* [ ] Determine location of storage. XDG? Package-local? Global state?
* [ ] Create and write JSON of song/feature metadata.
* [ ] Reset training data. By age/genre/name/source/
      Plus renew/overwrite flag.
* [ ] Fully 'MFExtractor' class init by CLI passed args. Seed the members of @dataclass
* [ ] All this AI stuff man.
* [ ] Select only the most promising music features to train the model.
* [ ] Scramble input music or random noise as negative test against the models?
* [ ] VLC integration?
